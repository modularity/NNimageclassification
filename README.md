# NNimageclassification
Neural Network for Image Classification final project for UCLA M156: Machine Learning, Spring 2017

	• Code the neural network 
	• Define a training set and a test set
	• Test several different designs of your network
	• Evaluate performance in various scenarios (different classes to discriminate)
	• Bonus: Pre-process the data with PCA to see how it affects performance and running time
